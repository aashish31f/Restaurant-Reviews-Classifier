# Restaurant-Reviews-Classifier
This is a review classifier which can be used to classify the reviews such as movie reviews  , shop reviews ,book reviews or any other review as positive or negative . Here I have implemented it based on the reviews of customers of a restaurant . I have used the nltk , re ,sklearn libraries in implementing this classifier . It can be used directly to find the targetted customers to fulfil their expectations 
thus saving time and increasing profit .
